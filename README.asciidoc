== Introduction
The global lib structure is package based and the hierarchy is as follows:

[source]
----
com
 |
 \- capgemini
     |
     \- productionline
         |
         |- configuration (containing all packages for configuring the components of the ProductionLine) 
         |
         |- build (common functions used during build process)
         |
         \- deployment (common functions used during the deployment process)
----

For further information (like usage examples) please have a look in the `doc/configuration` folder of this repository. To find detailed information about the available methods please take a look at the *groovydoc* documentation in each class ( `src/com/capgemini/productionline/configuration` ).

=== Install plugins used by library
* Allure Jenkins Plugin

=== Build a new Job based on the template

To use the 'SharedLib for Production Line' in a Jenkins-Job just create a new Pipeline and start using it as shown below.

```Groovy
@Library('ProductionLineTemplateLib')

import com.capgemini.productionline.configuration.*
Jenkins jenkinsConfiguration = new Jenkins();

```
